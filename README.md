# touchDesigner
Just some messing around with Lasers, Kinect, and maybe more. I am no pro but wanted to share projects I made. You may find that some of these are incomplete projects, but I have no idea what I am doing on here, so please don't mind the clutter. 

Working Files: LaserKinect Line Trace, Stickfigure (Works for producing arms and legs), and more to come.
